# Bamazon
### bamaonCustomer.js
This file allows a user to shop the products list (ID, name, and price) available and gives them an option to buy or exit. If the User chooses buy, it askes them which item they would like to buy. It then asks them to choose how many they would like to buy. If the quanity they want is more then is in stock it tells the user "Insufficient Quanity" and has them pick an item again. If there is enough quanity, it tells the user the total amount of their purchase and takes them back to the menu asking them if they want to buy or Exit. If the User chooses exit, it ends the connection.
### bamazonManager.js
The User is shown five options; view inventory, view low inventory, add stock, add new product, and Exit. View inventory shows the User what product they have and give the option to exit to main menu. View low inventory show the User inventory with stock lower than 5 and give the option to exit to main menu. Add Stock allows the User to choose what product or item then how much they will be adding, once done it will tell the user they have succesfully added that total amount and give the option to exit to main menu.
